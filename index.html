			<!-- INTRODUCTION OF THE DATASTORY -->
			<div class="Intro">
				<h2 class="Title">#Abstract</h2>

				<p>The outcome of the 2016 US election were a surprise, only few experts predicted a Trump win. Since then, it has been revealed that the Russian might have had an influence on the election through their action on social media, especially Twitter. It has been revealed that many Twitter acounts were actually troll accounts trying to play with the public opinion. Is it true? Did it work? Can we found any correlation between those tweets and the public opinion during the elections? <br>
				Moreover, the troll accounts were active in a larger span than just the Presidential elections. They might have tried to play the public opinion into the approval of Trump as president as well.</p>

			<!-- TROLL CHARACTERIZATION -->
			<div class="TrollChar">
				<h2 class="Title">#What are the Trolls</h2>

				<p>What are the trolls? How much do they tweet? How many followers do they have? This is a high level characterization of trolls, but it helps to understand how they work. 
				<br>The plot below present the tweet activity of Right and Left trolls along time.</p>

                </object>

                <p>The spikeness of the troll tweet activity shows that they usually don't tweet too much, but there are some date/periode in which the number of tweet explodes! Right Trolls seems to tweet more than the Left as more spikes are present.</p>
